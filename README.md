# lfmm-python
This is a python implementation of the R library [lfmm](https://github.com/bcm-uga/lfmm/blob/master/R/lfmm.R)

## Setup
To start

```python
git clone git@github.com:israfelsr/lfmm-python.git
cd lfmm-python
python3 -m venv lfmm-python-venv
source lfmm-python-venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
```

## Demos
Here you can find a demo of the R library [here](https://bcm-uga.github.io/lfmm/articles/lfmm) and [this notebook](https://github.com/israfelsr/lfmm-python/blob/main/notebooks/demo.ipynb) show the use of the python code.
It's possible to see that the code is quite similar so if you are familiar with the R library you can easily use it on python.
